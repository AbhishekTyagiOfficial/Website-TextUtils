            <p>
              Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the
              types of personal information we receive and collect when you use
              our website and how we safeguard your information. We never sell
              your personal information to third parties and strive to keep it
              secure.
            </p>
            <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
            <br />
            <p>
              When you visit our website, we may collect certain information,
              such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system. We
              may also use cookies to enhance your browsing experience. This
              information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track
              user navigation, and gather demographic information for aggregate
              use.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to provide personal information, such as your name
              or email address, we may collect it to respond to your inquiries,
              process your requests, or provide you with relevant information
            </p>
            .<br />
            <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong> <br />
            <p>
              We do not share your personal information with third parties
              unless required by law or with your explicit consent. However, we
              may share aggregated demographic information with trusted partners
              for statistical purposes, but this information does not include
              any personally identifiable information.
            </p>
            <br />
            <strong>Data Security</strong> <br />
            <p>
              We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of your
              personal information and protect it from unauthorized access or
              disclosure. However, no data transmission over the internet can be
              guaranteed as completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the
              absolute security of your information.
